# Binary-Tree-for-Large-Dimension-Data-Search
This small preject is try to use binary tree to speedup the data whose dimension is very large.

## Step
1. Generate 1000000 datas with 10 dimension, and every dimension is generated by Gaussian distribution
2. Construct a binary search tree for every dimension
3. Sort query vector from big attribute to small attribute
4. Search binary serach tree with accuracy for the biggest dimension of the query
5. The other dimension use linear search
